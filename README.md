# BOEAccessExam
Java Web App designed for my team to replace a paper test being used with an automated service. The exam has four parts, each with randomized questions, each with randomized answers. When a user gets a passing grade an email is sent to a staff member who creates a new account for the user, and a certificate is shown to the user for their records.
